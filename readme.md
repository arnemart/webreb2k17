# Web Rebels 2017 presentation

If you want to see the slides, God help you, run `npm install` and then `npm run`. Slides will show in your terminal, and the presenter notes will be at `localhost:3000`.

Code is in the `src`-folder. The main files are `tokenizer.js`, `parser.js`, `generator.js` and `compiler.js` -- the `slide-*.js`-files are used by me during the presentation.
